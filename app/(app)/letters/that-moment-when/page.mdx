# ‚ö° That moment when 270,000 users hit deploy at once...

Something I've been excited about recently (and think you should be too) is AI Agents.

AI agents are changing how our apps handle user input. Previously, users had to fill out forms exactly right, or the app would break. Agents can understand messy, natural input and still get the job done.

Here's a real example: Say you type 'remind me to call Dave from the backend team about the database next Thursday.' An agent is smart enough to:

- Create a calendar invite (since it seems you want to meet)
- Find Dave in your work directory and add him
- Put the details in the invite
- Set up a reminder
- Mark it as a tech meeting

Before agents, we had to write many rigid rules to handle this. We'd need code to check if something should be a task or a calendar event, find the right person, and set everything up. It was like building a huge decision tree where everything had to be spelled out. Now agents can figure this stuff out on their own, making our apps much more flexible and user-friendly.

The best part? You don't need to wait to start building with agents.¬†You can build your own multi-agent systems with tools like¬†[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable//index.html), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [CrewA](https://www.crewai.com/)I today.

Trust me, you'll have a blast seeing how flexible they can be.

Now after my little bit of excitement, here's the rest of the newsletter.

## üß† AI Crush CFP

I'm hosting my first conference!

It's called AI Crush and it's in Belfast. We are looking for presenters to share their insights on May 9th, 2025. This inaugural event represents a unique opportunity to be part of something special in Northern Ireland's growing tech scene.

Whether you're building AI-powered applications, exploring machine learning architectures, or implementing practical AI solutions, we want to hear your story. As a first-year conference, speakers have the rare opportunity to help shape the event's direction and be part of its founding moment.

Think you've got something valuable to share? Know someone who does? The CFP (Call for Presentations) is open now - don't miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking event!

It's dual track (one stage for developers and one for leadership) so we need talks for both stages.
