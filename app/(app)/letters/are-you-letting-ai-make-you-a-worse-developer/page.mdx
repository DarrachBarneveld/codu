# ‚ö†Ô∏è Are you letting AI make you a worse developer?

It‚Äôs easier than ever to generate code with AI tools. But here‚Äôs the catch: if you don‚Äôt understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you could end up with bad or broken code. AI isn‚Äôt a replacement for solid knowledge.

Think of AI as your helper, not your teacher. You should guide and correct it, not depend on it to fill gaps in your skills. When you truly know the fundamentals, you‚Äôll spot mistakes, write cleaner code, and build better websites.

The tools we use will keep changing, but the core of web development stays the same.

Mastering the basics is how you stay ready for anything.

It's called AI Crush and it's in Belfast. We are looking for presenters to share their insights on May 9th, 2025. This inaugural event represents a unique opportunity to be part of something special in Northern Ireland's growing tech scene.

Whether you're building AI-powered applications, exploring machine learning architectures, or implementing practical AI solutions, we want to hear your story. As a first-year conference, speakers have the rare opportunity to help shape the event's direction and be part of its founding moment.

It's dual track (one stage for developers and one for leadership) so we need talks for both stages.
