## üß† AI Crush CFP

I'm hosting my first conference!

It's called AI Crush, and it's in Belfast. We're looking for presenters to share their insights on **May 9th, 2025**. This inaugural event is a unique opportunity to be part of something special in Northern Ireland's growing tech scene.

Whether you're building AI-powered applications, exploring machine learning architectures, or implementing practical AI solutions, we want to hear your story. As a first-year conference, speakers have the rare opportunity to help shape the event's direction and be part of its founding moment.

Think you've got something valuable to share? Know someone who does? The CFP (Call for Presentations) is open now‚Äîdon't miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking event!

It's dual-track (one stage for developers and one for leadership), so we need talks for both stages.
