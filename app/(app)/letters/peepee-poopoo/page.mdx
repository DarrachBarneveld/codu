# PeePee PooPoo

I didn't forget you all last week... I was on holiday!

It's the longest break from my laptop in over a decade. I made an executive decision to ignore it, and I hope that most of you will forgive me.

**And for the subject line:** I'm working off a couple of hours of sleep since I got in this morning, and I'm feeling silly.

Now, here are all of this week's picks. ‚¨á

## üìñ Book of the Week

**[Product-Led Growth: How to Build a Product That Sells Itself](https://amzn.to/3vQZ8Xk)**

If you're tired of building features that users ignore, this book is your gateway to creating self-selling products. Bush breaks down how companies like Slack and Dropbox grew exponentially by making their products their primary growth engine.

What makes it great for developers:

- Practical frameworks for instrumenting user onboarding and measuring product engagement
- Clear guidance on building viral loops and network effects into your product architecture
- Real examples of feature prioritization that drives organic user acquisition
- Technical insights into implementing freemium models effectively

The book is especially valuable if you're working on SaaS products or considering a move into product management. Bush's emphasis on data-driven decision-making and user behavior analysis aligns perfectly with a developer's analytical mindset.

Learn how to transform your technical features into clear user value, ensuring adoption happens naturally rather than through aggressive sales tactics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Something Cool

**[Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza](https://amzn.to/3TNzR8v)**

Nope, not another random subject line. It's a game I played a good bit while I was away.
It's a simple card game but great fun.

Players take turns saying "taco," "cat," "goat," "cheese," or "pizza" while simultaneously flipping cards. When the word matches the card, everyone races to slap the pile. Last hand down draws cards. It's quick with 10-15 minute rounds.

My stomach hurt from laughter playing this one, so it might be the perfect thing to pick up for the holidays.
