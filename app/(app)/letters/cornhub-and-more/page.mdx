# üåΩ CornHub Controversy & Why Dropping F-Bombs Beats AI Search Results

We kicked off 2025 with a bang at our first Cod√∫ event of the year, packing the house with eager developers ready to dive into some seriously cool tech.

Hubspot's own [Evan Burbidge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-burbidge-a0823361/) took us on a mind-bending journey through the world of 3D drag-and-drop form wizards. Who knew form building could be so spatial? Evan shared the actual tools his team uses at Hubspot, giving us a peek behind the curtain at how they're revolutionizing multi-step forms.

Then things got... corny. In my live coding session with Cursor.com's AI pair programmer, we attempted to build "CornHub" -- a totally innocent website for locating quality corn in your area.

While some AI models (from Anthropic and OpenAI) seemed oddly hesitant to help with our wholesome agricultural endeavor (wink), Deepseek stepped up to the plate, helping us create a beautiful hub for all things corn.

Who knew finding local corn could be so controversial?

## üß† AI Crush CFP

I'm hosting my first conference!

It's called AI Crush and it's in Belfast. We are looking for presenters to share their insights on May 9th, 2025. This inaugural event represents a unique opportunity to be part of something special in Northern Ireland's growing tech scene.

Whether you're building AI-powered applications, exploring machine learning architectures, or implementing practical AI solutions, we want to hear your story. As a first-year conference, speakers have the rare opportunity to help shape the event's direction and be part of its founding moment.

Think you've got something valuable to share? Know someone who does? The CFP (Call for Presentations) is open now - don't miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking event!

It's dual track (one stage for developers and one for leadership) so we need talks for both stages.
