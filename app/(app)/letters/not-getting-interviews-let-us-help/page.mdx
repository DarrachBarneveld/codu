# üñ•Ô∏è Not Getting Interviews? Let us help! + More Useful Articles

Here's something I've noticed lately while talking to both hiring managers and job seekers: if you're not getting interview responses, it's likely your CV needs work - not your skills. I'm seeing developers with similar experience levels getting vastly different response rates. The difference? How they present their experience.

For example, instead of:\
"Built features and fixed bugs for the company website"

Try:\
"Led development of the company's checkout process, reducing cart abandonment by 15%"

It's the same experience, but one shows your actual impact. If you're struggling to get responses, don't get discouraged - your skills aren't the issue. The market is tough, but developers are still getting hired daily. The key is presenting your experience effectively.

Speaking of which - we've got a great community of developers in the Cod√∫ Discord who regularly help review CVs and provide constructive feedback. Anyone who signs up on [www.codu.co](http://www.codu.co) gets a free invite. Drop your CV in the `#career-advice` channel. Sometimes, a fresh pair of eyes is all you need to make your experience shine!

## üìñ Book of the Week

**[Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth](https://amzn.to/40W9lPE)**

A must-read for developers looking to understand how to grow their products beyond just building features. The book breaks down 19 marketing channels and introduces the "Bullseye Framework" for systematically finding which channels work best for your startup.

What makes it particularly valuable for developers is:

1. Its data-driven, systematic approach to marketing (similar to how we approach technical problems)

2. Clear, actionable frameworks for testing different growth channels

3. Real-world examples from successful startups

4. Focus on measurable results rather than vague marketing concepts

The book helps bridge the gap between technical expertise and customer acquisition - something many developers struggle with. It's especially useful if you're working on a side project or startup and need to think beyond the code.

The most valuable takeaway is that building a great product is only half the battle - you need a deliberate strategy to get it in front of users. This book gives you the tools to do that methodically.

## üõ†Ô∏è Something Cool

**[Wirebound Pocket Notebook (the one I use)](https://amzn.to/4hYZLBq)**

I usually have a notebook in my pocket. Recently, I was advised to grab one so that you can tear the pages out easily and remove tasks as you go through your notes.

It's been a great productivity hack. I work my way through the pages, tear them out, and throw them away when I'm done.

If my notebook doesn't get smaller each day, I know I'm not focusing on the important things.

**One more thing:** I'm traveling next week, so I might not be connected to the internet long enough to get out a newsletter.\
Behave while I'm away... Or don't; I prefer chaos, to be honest.

Thanks, and stay awesome,
