# üîé Murder Mystery for Developers + Career Advice

It's the end of the year season, and a lot of people are doing their end-of-year reviews.

Remember that fantastic bug fix from six months ago?

The one that saved the company thousands?

No???

That's the problem.

Every developer has been there -- it's performance review season, or you are updating a CV, and you're struggling to remember all the amazing work you've done over the past months/years. Projects blend, achievements become fuzzy, and those small but significant wins disappear from memory.

This is why I started keeping a brag document years ago, and it's transformed how I approach my career development.

I wrote [this article](https://www.codu.co/articles/building-a-brag-document-rllnfdad) to outline what a "brag document" is and how to get started.

## üìñ Book of the Week

**[The Product-Led Playbook](https://amzn.to/4is4QTc)**

Last week, I suggested [Product-Led Growth: How to Build a Product That Sells Itself](http://amzn.to/3Vip2gg). Since then, I have found out the second book in the series, "The Product-Led Playbook," is a thing. The playbook focuses on the how rather than the why outlined in the previous book. I read this in a few days because I found it so interesting and useful.

This is one of the most practical books I have for anyone hoping to launch a SaaS product or improve their thinking about product development for self-service customers.

**[SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)**

Yup, you read that right.

It's quite possibly the nerdiest way to test your SQL skills.
