## üìñ Book of the Week

**[Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track](https://amzn.to/41AhCsD)**

If you've ever wondered about growing your career beyond "senior developer" without jumping into management, this book is for you. Will Larson has created the definitive guide to technical leadership, and it's the perfect read while you're taking a break from writing code.

This book is unique because it breaks down the often mysterious path to Staff Engineer through real stories and practical strategies. Larson interviewed dozens of Staff+ engineers from companies like Stripe, Square, and Slack to understand what this role looks like in practice.

The book is particularly valuable because it:

- Demystifies the different types of Staff Engineer roles (Did you know there are four distinct archetypes?)
- Provides concrete examples of what Staff Engineers do day-to-day
- Offers practical guidance on how to operate at this level
- Shows you how to navigate the transition from Senior to Staff Engineer

Whether you're actively pursuing a Staff Engineer role or just curious about what's beyond Senior Developer, this book gives you a clear map of the terrain ahead. It's one of those rare technical books that's deeply insightful and immediately practical.

If you've got some downtime over the holidays, this could be the perfect investment in your 2025 career growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Something Cool

**[Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/)**

Did you enjoy last week's SQL Murder Mystery? Here's another nerdy puzzle to keep your brain ticking over the holiday break.

Imagine combining the satisfaction of solving a crossword puzzle with the mind-bending challenge of regular expressions. That's exactly what Regex Crossword delivers. Each puzzle presents you with a grid where the clues are regex patterns, and you need to fill in characters that match all the patterns simultaneously.

Start with tutorials if you're new to regex, or dive straight into progressively harder challenges if you feel confident. Fair warning: what starts as "I'll just try one puzzle" can quickly turn into a hours!

This might be the most productive procrastination you'll do over the holidays. Just don't blame me if you get addicted to solving `^[CHRS]{4}$` type puzzles!
